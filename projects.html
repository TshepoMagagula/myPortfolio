                    My web development expertise includes front-end (HTML5, CSS, AlpineJS) and 
                    back-end (JavaScript, Node.js, SQL) operations, developing RESTful APIs,
                    and testing with Mocha.js. Additionally, I performed data cleaning and 
                    validation using Python, and trained and tested machine learning models.

                        This is one of the projects I'm the most proud of to have worked on.
                        This web application was developed to aid health care professionals in
                        dealing with the scourge of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and Heart Failure.
                        It uses two machine learning models to diagnose CAD and Heart Failure
                        at an early stage.

                    <p>
                        This web application uses Restful APIs to allow users to make Pizza
                        orders. It allows users to add their orders to a cart, which calculates
                        the totals of the orders, and it keeps track of all the user's
                        historical orders.

                    <p>
                        This web application was developed to help an ISP (Internet Service Provider)
                        bill its customers based on their calls, sms', and data usage. The user can
                        add a predetermined price plan (which contains details about the cost of a
                        phone call, the cost of an sms, and the cost of data).

                        This application was developed to manage taxi ques in the rank.
                        It keeps track of the number of people that are in the que, 
                        the number of people that join the que, the number of people 
                        that leave the que, and updates the number of people in the que
                        when a taxi departs.
